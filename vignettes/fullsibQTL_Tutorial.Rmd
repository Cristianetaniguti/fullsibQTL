`fullsibQTL` is an `R` package to perform QTL mapping in
outbred/outcrossing species using the model develop by Gazaffi et al
2014 (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11295-013-0664-2). We
consider as a mapping population a full-sib progeny (or *F1*
population) derived by a bi-parental cross between two non-homozygous
parents, with a genetic map obtained from markers possibly showing
different segregation patterns. We assumed that the phenotypic traits
are continuous and have a normal distribution. Also, the genetic map
must be previously made using the R package `onemap`
(https://github.com/augusto-garcia/onemap).

If you are not familiar with `onemap` and its approach to build a map,
we strongly encourage you to read `onemap`
[vignettes](https://github.com/augusto-garcia/onemap/tree/master)
(Margarido et al., 2007). 

In this tutorial, to illustrate the usage of `fullsibQTL` we analyze
the dataset present by Gazaffi et al. (2014) when proposing the
method. The purpose is to help users dealing with this package and
understanding the outputs. It is not our intention to teach the basis
doing a QTL analysis, so for a better understand about the method see
Gazaffi et al. (2014).

Users of `fullsibQTL` are supposed to have some experience with R,
since the analysis is done using the command line. Previous knowledge
of `onemap` is also desirably, once the genetic map is obtained with
this software. But by no means one needs to be on expert on any of
them to use the package.

`fullsibQTL` is available under the GNU General Public License, it is
open-source and the code can be changed freely. It comes with no
warranty. It is implemented as a package to be used under the freely
distributed `R` software, which is a language and environment for
statistical computing

If you are not familiar with `R`, we recommend reading the vignette
[Introduction to
R](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/augusto-garcia/onemap/blob/master/inst/doc/Introduction_R.html).
If you are not familiar with `onemap`, we recommend the reading of
vignette [How to build a linkage map for outcrossing
populations](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/augusto-garcia/onemap/blob/master/inst/doc/Outcrossing_Populations.html).

Moreover, there are three additional tutorials:

# Required data
The input file of `fullsibQTL` is the same as the one required by
`onemap` package. There are details about it at `onemap`
[vignette](http://augustogarcia.me/onemap/vignettes_highres/Outcrossing_Populations.html).


Below there is an example of such a file. The header line indicates
the data type, the following line with `10 5 0 0 2` indicates that the
data has, respectively, 10 individuals, 5 markers, no chromosome
information for these markers (indicated by 0), no physical position
information for the markers (0), and two phenotypic traits (0). This file is
somehow similar to a `MAPMAKER/EXP` file (used a long time ago), but
has additional information about the crosstype. It uses the symbol `-`
for missing data.

```

```

# Creating the working object
Once the file with raw data was created, it is necessary to import it
and provide more details required for QTL mapping.

First you need to read the raw data with `onemap::read_onemap`
function. After, you need to combine it with another object with
information of linkages groups, created with function
`create_fullsib`.

This is illustrated in the following example, where we import the raw
data and a list with four linkages groups, with distances measure with  
kosambi mapping function (Kosambi, 1944) (argument `map.function`).
Note that we also specified argument `step` with value 1. This option
is used for the computation of the conditional multipoint probability
of QTL genotypes, which is used for QTL mapping (see Gazaffi et al.
2014 for details).  If `step=0` is used, the probabilities will be
computed only in the position of each marker (allowing the analysis
even with missing data).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(fullsibQTL)

# Raw data
fs_data <- read_onemap( dir = "C:/workingdirectory", inputfile = "filename.raw" )


## Information of linkage groups, step and mapping function
fsib <- create_fullsib( fs_data,
                        map.list = list( LG1_final, LG2_final, LG3_final, LG4_final ),
                        step = 1, map.function = "kosambi" )
```

After loading the data, the user can look at the `onemap` object's
summary:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fs_data
```

For `fullsibQTL` object's:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fsib
```

If one wants to see an example of the data file format (raw data), type the
following, that will show the location of a file that is distributed
with the package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
system.file( "extdata", "example_QTLfullsib.raw", package = "fullsibQTL" )
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
library(fullsibQTL)
```

In this tutorial we will use as an example an R object distributed
with the package. It has: a) raw data in the `onemap` format
(`example_QTLfullsib`); b) four ordered linkage groups (`LG1_final`,
`LG2_final`, `LG3_final`, and `LG4_final`); two objects with
permutations, that will be explained later (named `im_perm` and
`cim_perm`). They are the same ones described at Gazaffi et al.
(2014).

To load the example data:
```{r, eval=TRUE,cache=FALSE}
## Loading the example data
data( "example_QTLfullsib" ) 

## Checking if it worked
ls() 

## Printing some of the loaded objects
example_QTLfullsib
LG1_final
```

Again, the map was built with `onemap` package. Now, we have to
combine the raw data with the linkage groups (hereafter named LG) into
a single object. This is done with function `create_fullsib`:

```{r, eval=TRUE, results='hide'}
fsib <- create_fullsib( example_QTLfullsib,
                        map.list = list( LG1_final, LG2_final, LG3_final, LG4_final ),
                        step = 1, map.function = "kosambi" )
```

Checking it:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
fsib
```

This object contains a genetic map composed by four LGs, with their
length and segregation patterns indicated in the output. There are
also five unlinked makers. This might be helpful for further QTL
analysis for species where the map does not cover the whole genome,
using the single marker analysis. The object also has information for
two phenotypes, with conditional probabilities calculated every 1 cM
(using Kosambi function).

# Interval mapping

To perform interval mapping, one should use two functions, `im_scan`
and `im_char`. `im_scan` scans all the genome testing for statistical
associations between genotype and phenotype, *i.e.*, trying to detect
QTL. `im_char` shows the genetic effects and their significance tests,
as well as some additional tests to infer QTL segregation pattern.

## IM Genome scan

To perform a genome scan:

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, results='hide'}
im <- im_scan( fullsib = fsib, lg = "all", pheno.col = 1, LOD = TRUE )
```

Argument `fullsib` refers to the object created using function
`create_fullsib`; `lg` indicates which linkage groups must be scanned
(another way of representing it is `lg=1:4`). The function default is
`lg=all`, to scan every LG. The argument `pheno.col` indicates which
phenotype will be considered (it defaults to 1, the first trait),
using an integer. The argument `LOD=TRUE` indicates that the mapping
result must be shown using LOD scores, if `FALSE`, the scale will be
shown as $-log_{10}(p_{value})$.

The mapping result can be viewed by typing the object name:
```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, R.options=list(max.print=50)}
im
```

Another way to see the results is using `print` and specifying the LG:
```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, R.options=list(max.print=50)}
print( im, lg = 1 )
```

The resulting object of `im_scan` is a matrix with five columns and
*k* lines, where *k* is the number of genome positions in which the
conditional probabilities have been computed based on the `step`
argument of the earlier `create_fullsib` function. In this object, the
row names are the identification of each position (it can be the
marker name itself or a pseudo-marker, with an automatically created
name in the format `loc` + number (corresponding to a step between
markers). The second column is the linkage group, and the third is the
position (in centiMorgan). The fourth column has the LOD Score value
(or the $-log_{10}(p_{value})$). The fifth column reefers to the model
utilized for the computations (that will be detailed later).

For helping visualization of the results of QTL mapping, function
`summary(im)` can be used to print just the highest LOD score value
(or the $-log_{10}(p_{value})$) for every LG. The user can set a
threshold (`thr` argument) to see only the scores above this. When
there is more than one QTL in the same LG, the user has to manually
look for it using some graphical visualization.

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
summary( im )
```

## QTL mapping plot options

For graphical visualizations, there are two functions: `plot` and
`plot_fullsibQTL`. Function `plot` is simpler and it is a good option
for quick observations. Function `plot_fullsibQTL` is recommended for
more detailed analysis; it has also an option for interactive
analysis, allowing tools such as mouse zoom and hover.

To use function `plot`:

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
plot( im )
```

Users can customize the output. For example, it is possible to plot in
the same panel up to five mapping profiles. Moreover, the user can
indicate the molecular marker's position, change the labels, among
others features. You can find more information about available options
typing `?plot.fullsib_scan` or on its vignette, typing
```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
vignette("Graphical_options_with_plot" ,package="fullsibQTL")
```

Function  `plot_fullsibQTL`  is more sophisticated and interactive.
Try it with 
```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
plot_fullsibQTL( fullsib = fsib, fullsib.scan = im )
```

To plot interactive graphics:
```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
plot_fullsibQTL( fullsib = fsib, fullsib.scan = im, interact = TRUE )
```

It will generate this interactive html  [graphic](http://statgen.esalq.usp.br/fullsibQTL_graphics/im.html).

You can find more information about `plot_fullsibQTL` in the vignette:
```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
vignette("Graphical_options_with_plot_fullsibQTL" ,package="fullsibQTL")
```


## Covariates

To improve the mapping statistical power, it is possible to include
covariates (as fixed effects) in the QTL model, in order to control
the variability outside the mapping interval (OR, IN ORDER TO CONTROL
ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES?). To set a full-rank matrix which controls
the phenotypic variance, first you need to define an incidence vector,
and, then, set it as an argument of the function `im_scan`. An example
follows:

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, results='hide'}
covar <- matrix( rep( c( 1 ,-1 ), each = 150 ), ncol = 1 )
im_covar <- im_scan( fsib, pheno.col = 1, addcovar = covar )
```

NÃO ENTENDI... UMA COVARIÃVEL? ELA CONTROLA O QUE, EXATAMENTE?

PARTE?


## IM Permutation test

The threshold for QTL detection can be set using permutation tests
(Churchill and Doerge, 1994) adding the argument `n.perm` in the
`im_scan` function. As the permutation test is a sampling process, it
is recommended that users set a seed before the permutations, if they
want to repeat the procedure. The argument `write.perm` allows the
user to save a text file with information about the permutations. 

In this tutorial, the permutation test object `im_perm` with the seed
`1234` is already created and is part of the `example_QTLfullsib`
object (previously loaded), so there is no need to run the following
lines. Anyway, an example of how to perform the permutation is the
following:
```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE, collapse=TRUE, results='hide'}
## Perfoming the permutation
set.seed( 1234 )
im_perm <- im_scan( fsib, pheno.col = 1, n.perm = 1000,
                    write.perm = "im_permutations.txt" )
```

If one needs to safe keep the object with the results of permutations,
for further analysis, the object can be saved as an `Rdata` object. To
save and load it, use:
```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
save( im_perm, file = "im_permutations.Rdata" )
load( "im_permutations.Rdata" )
```

The permutation test demands some time. At the end of the process,
`im_perm` receives a matrix with *p* lines, where *p* is the number of
the realized permutations, and two columns with the highest and second
highest peak values. The definition of the second peak is the same as
the one defined by Chen and Storey (2006), *i.e*, the highest LOD
score (or $-log_{10}(p_{value})$) of the genome disregarding the LG
where the highest peak was achieved. The threshold values can be
visualized with function `summary` applied to the object with the
permutation tests. In this case, the user can set an $\alpha$
significance threshold. The result will be the quantile $(1-\alpha)
\times 100$ of the samples. The function default is to show $\alpha$
values equal to $0.10$ and $0.05$.

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
## Summary of the permutation test
summary( im_perm )
summary( im_perm, alpha = 0.05 )

## Getting the peaks for alpha 0.05.
im.peak1 <- summary( im_perm, alpha = 0.05 )[ 1, 1 ]
im.peak1
im.peak2 <- summary( im_perm,alpha = 0.05 )[ 1, 2 ]
im.peak2

## Plotting the second peak in the graphic
plot( im )
abline( h = im.peak2, col = "red" )

## Plotting both thresholds
plot( im, lty = 1, lwd = 2, incl.mkr = NULL, cex.incl = 0.7, 
      cex.axis = 0.8, col = "blue", ylab = "LOD Score", xlab = "Linkage Group", 
      main = "IM - Trait 1" )
abline( h = im.peak1, lty = 2, lwd = 1, col = "black" )
abline( h = im.peak2, lty = 2, lwd = 2, col = "black" )
```

If one wants to see the distribution of maximum values (selected for
each permutation), function `plot` can be applied to `perm` object. If
`peak` argument is set as 2, the distribution of the second highest
peaks will be showed. Vertical lines represent the cut-off threshold
for $\alpha=0.05$.

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
plot( im_perm, peak = 1 )
abline( v = im.peak1 )
abline( v = im.peak1, col = "red" )

plot( im_perm, peak = 2 )
abline( v = 3.419819, col = "blue" )
abline( v = 2.497431, col = "red" )
```

## IM QTL characterization

After the determination of the number and position of the QTLs, the
user can characterize the mapped QTLs. This relates to identify the
significant effects, the segregation pattern and linkage phases
between QTLs and flanking markers. The already created object `im`
shows the presence of at least 4 QTLs:

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
summary( im )
```

The characterization of these 4 regions is achieved with function
`im_char`:

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
qtl1 <- im_char( fsib, pheno.col = 1, lg = 1, pos = "loc4" )
qtl2 <- im_char( fsib, pheno.col = 1, lg = 2, pos = "M27" )
qtl3 <- im_char( fsib, pheno.col = 1, lg = 3, pos = "loc64" )
qtl4 <- im_char( fsib, pheno.col = 1, lg = 4, pos = "loc56" )
```

Notice that positions "loc4", "M27", "loc64", and "loc56" are the ones
presented in the `im` object and visualized when function `summary`
was applied. For example, the object with the characterization of the QTL on LG 1 is:

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
qtl1
```

Object `qtl1` (a matrix) has several information. The first line has
the LG information, the second has the position in centiMorgan where
the QTL is localized. The third and fourth lines shows, respectively,
$-log_{10}(p_{value})$) and LOD Score. The fifth line (`mu`) is about
the intercept. `alpha.p`, `alpha.q`, and `delta.pq` represent the QTL
genetic effects; `LOD.alpha.p`, `LOD.alpha.q`, and `LOD.delta.pq` are
the statistics associated with the marginal tests of significance of
these genetic effects, with 1 degree of freedom (testing just if the
effect differs from zero). In this case, a LOD score above or equal
$0.83$ (equivalent to a likelihood ratio test of LRT $= 3.81$, which
has an approximate $\chi^2$ distribution with 1 degree of freedom
under the null hypothesis). Since this is done only on specific
positions, it is not necessary to correct for multiple tests.
`H4.pvalue`, `H5.pvalue`, and `H6.pvalue` show the p-values for
additional tests necessary to infer QTL segregation. For more
information, please see Gazaffi et al. (2014). 

Finally, line `model` shows which model was considered; please see
details on the vignette *QTL mapping with partially informative
markers*. In some cases, a given test cannot be performed, showing
`NA` as their values values. In short, outcrossing species can have a
combination of markers with different segregation patterns, and in
some genomic regions the amount of information can be different. For
example, a genomic with markers segregating only in one of the parents
will not allow inference about QTL in the other parent, so the model
needs to be adapted accordingly. For details see Gazaffi et al.
(2014).

We can print information for all  QTL simultaneously:

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
cbind( qtl1, qtl2, qtl3, qtl4 )
```

The analysis of the linkage phases allows to detect the localization
of the QTL allele which increases or reduces the trait. To do so, look
for `LOD.alpha.p` and `LOD.alpha.q`. In order to facilitate
interpretation, the function `draw_phase` and can be used as follows:

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
draw_phase( fsib, qtl1, 0.05 )
```
The value $0.05$ relates to $\alpha$ (significance level) and it is
used to show only QTL statistically significant at this level. Alleles
$P1$ and $Q1$ have positive effects, while $P2$ and $Q2$ have negative
ones; $P0$ and $Q0$ have no significant effects.

To infer the QTL segregation, the user should use function `get_segr`
function. It uses the default of $\alpha=0.05$ for the significance
level of marginal tests (`LOD.alpha.p`, `LOD.alpha.q`, `LOD.delta.pq`)
and complementary ones (`H4.pvalue`, `H5.pvalue`, `H6.pvalue`). For
example:

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
get_segr( qtl1 )
get_segr( qtl2 )
get_segr( qtl3 )
get_segr( qtl4 )
```

# Selection of Cofactors

Before proceeding to composite interval mapping (CIM), it is necessary
to define which markers will be used as cofactors. They will be used
to control variation outside the mapping interval. To do so, there are
two functions: `cof_selection` and `cof_definition`.

## Cofactor selection using multiple linear regression

Function `cof_selection` allows to select cofactors using multiple
linear regression with the *stepwise* procedure. The criteria
information is utilized to determine if a given cofactor is kept or
not in the model. Basically, this function first prepares the data and
then uses `step` from `stats` package. For more information, use
`?cof_selection`.

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, results='hide'}
cofs_fs <- cof_selection( fsib, pheno.col = 1, k = log( 300 ), n.cofactor = 10 )
```
```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
plot( cofs_fs )
```

Object `fsib` is the same one created using function `create_fullsib`;
`pheno.col` indicates which phenotypic trait will be used in the
analysis; `k` is the penalty for the information criteria computation.
If `k=2`, it used Akaike Information Criteria; if `k=log(n)` (where
`n` is the mapping population size), it uses the Bayesian Information
Criteria. If the user wants to use another penalty values, we
recommend to look at the [QTL Cartographer v1.17
manual](http://statgen.ncsu.edu/qtlcart/manual.pdf), page 76, and also
the help of the R function `step`. In some situations, the process
would recommend to keep several cofactors which can lead to
overparametrization of the model. To control it, the argument
`n.cofactor` allows to the user to restrict the number of selected
cofactors up to a maximum, *i.e*, the proceeding to select cofactors
stops when the number of cofactors reaches what is defined in
`n.cofactor` (the default is `n.cofactor = 10`).

The following example shows how to proceed to select cofactors in a
situation where the fixed covariates are set to control the character
variability (NÃO ENTENDO). To do it, we used the argument `addcovar`.
For example:

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE,}
covar <- matrix( rep( c( 1, -1 ), each = 150 ), ncol = 1 )
cofs_fs2 <- cof_selection( fsib, pheno.col = 1, addcovar = covar, 
                           k = 2, thres.effect = 0.05 )
```

After the cofactor selection, `thres.effect=0.05` is used to verify if
there are remaining cofactors with no significant effects, and if this
is the case, they are removed. It is worth noting that each cofactor
can have up to three genetical effects (additive in both parents and
dominance), but not all them might be statistically significant. The
default of this argument is 1, *i.e*, there is no removal of
non-significant effects. This could lead to overparametrization, so
use it carefully. For more information, use (`?cof_selection`).

## Cofactor ad-hoc definition

Users can also select the cofactors using and *ad-hoc* procedure. This
is the case for example when someone knows that certain markers are
supposed to be linked with QTL. To do so, it is necessary to build a
matrix and then incorporate it in the `cof_definition` function:
```{r}
cofs <- matrix(c("1","M2",
                 "2","M27",
                 "3","M33",
                 "4","M52"), 4, 2, byrow = TRUE )
cofs_fsdef <- cof_definition( fsib, pheno.col = 1, 
                              thres.effect = 0.05, cof.pos = cofs)
```

# Composite Interval Mapping (CIM)

In order to proceed with composite interval mapping, there are two
functions: `cim_scan` and `cim_char`. They have analogous options of
functions `im_scan` and `im_char`. The first one scan all the genome
computing associations between genotype and phenotype trying to detect
QTL. The second shows the genetic effects and their statistical
significance. It also shows additional tests to infer the QTL
segregation pattern. The mapping procedure is performed in a similar
as already presented for `im_scan`. The inclusion of cofactors allows
a better mapping of QTL, since this model has more statistical power
than interval mapping. For more information, use `?cim_scan` and
`?cim_char`.

## CIM Genome scan

The genome scan can be performed with function `cim_scan`, indicating
the cofactors object (class: `fullsib_cofactors`) previously created
with `cof_selection` or `cof_definition`.
```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, results='hide'}
cim <- cim_scan( fullsib = cofs_fs, lg = "all", ws = 10, pheno.col = 1, LOD = TRUE )
```
Option `ws` (window size) is to indicate the size of a window outside
the mapping interval to block the inclusion of  cofactors. This is
important to not markers linked with the QTL being mapped to be
considered as other QTL.

## Permutation test

The threshold for QTL detection can be set using permutation tests
(Churchill and Doerge, 1994) adding the argument `n.perm` in the
`cim_scan` function. As the permutation test is a re-sampling process,
it is recommended that users set a seed before the permutations, in
order to be able to replicate the results. Argument `write.perm`
allows to save a text file with information about all the
permutations. In this tutorial, the permutation test object `cim_perm`
with the seed `4321` is already created and is part of the
`example_QTLfullsib` object previously loaded, so it is not necessary
to run the following lines. But just as an example:
```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
set.seed( 4321 )
cim_perm <- cim_scan( fullsib = cofs_fs, lg = "all", pheno.col = 1, 
                      LOD = TRUE, n.perm = 1000,
                      write.perm = "cim_permutations.txt" )
```

To keep the results of permutations for later analysis, one just needs
to save (and eventually load) an R object:
```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE, collapse=TRUE}
save( cim_perm, file = "cim_permutations.Rdata" )
load( "cim_permutations.Rdata" )
```

The permutation test demands some time. At the end of the process,
`cim_perm` receives a matrix with *p* lines, where *p* is the number
of the realized permutations, and 4 columns representing the first,
second, third, and fourth highest peak value, respectively, for the
statistic LOD (or $-log_{10}(p_{value})$). The definition of the
second peak is the same of the method two of Chen and Storey (2006),
*i.e*, the highest LOD score (or $-log_{10}(p_{value})$) of the genome
disregarding the LG where the highest peak was achieved. The third and
fourth peak definitions are analogous. This threshold values can be
visualized through `summary` for the object with the permutation
tests. In this case, the user can set an $\alpha$ for the significance
threshold. The result will be the quantile $(1-\alpha) \times 100$ of
permutation samples for the statistic (defaults $0.10$ an $0.05$).
```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
## Summary of the permutation test
summary( cim_perm )
## just with alpha=0.05 
summary( cim_perm, alpha = 0.05 )

## Getting the peaks for alpha 0.05. 
cim.peak1 <- summary(cim_perm, alpha=0.05)[1,1]
cim.peak1
cim.peak2 <- summary(cim_perm, alpha=0.05)[1,2]
cim.peak2

## Ploting the thrshold with the second peak
plot( cim )
abline( h = cim.peak2, col = "red" )

## Plotting both thresholds
plot( cim, lty = 1, lwd = 2, incl.mkr = NULL, cex.incl = 0.7, 
      cex.axis = 0.8, col = "red", ylab = "LOD Score", xlab = "Linkage Group", 
      main = "CIM - Trait 1" )
abline( h = cim.peak1, lty = 2, lwd = 1, col = "black" )
abline( h = cim.peak2, lty = 2, lwd = 2, col = "black" )
```

If one wants to see the distribution of the maximum of the LODs,
function `plot` can be used with `perm` object. If the `peak` argument
is `2`, the distribution of the second highest peaks will be showed.
The vertical line represents the cut-off threshold for $\alpha=0.05$.

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
plot( cim_perm, peak = 1 )
abline( v = cim.peak1, col = "red" )

plot( cim_perm, peak = 2 )
abline( v = cim.peak2, col = "red" )
```

## Characterization of mapped QTL with CIM

After the determination of the number and position of the QTLs, it is
possible to characterize the QTL, *i.e*., identify their significant
effects, segregation patterns and linkage phases with flanking
markers.

The already created object `cim` shows the presence of at least 4 QTLs:
```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
summary( cim )
```

However, the following graphic shows that there is evidence for more
QTL. This is because the automatic selection of peaks is not perfect,
demanding some user interaction. We do not recommend using automatic
procedures. 

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
## Plotting the CIM results
plot( cim, lty = 1, lwd = 2, incl.mkr = NULL, cex.incl = 0.7, 
      cex.axis = 0.8, col = "red", ylab = "LOD Score", xlab = "Linkage Group", 
      main = "CIM - Trait 1" )
abline( h = cim.peak1, lty = 2, lwd = 1, col = "black" )
abline( h = cim.peak2, lty = 2, lwd = 2, col = "black" )
```

The location of other peaks (meaning evidence for more QTL) can be
verified examining object `cim`. For example, for some LGs:

```{r, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE}
## Visual Analysis of every location of LG1
## QTLs peak at loc13 and M12
print( cim,lg = 1 )
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
## Visual Analysis LG2
## QTLs peaks at loc45, loc77, and loc 108
print( cim, lg = 2 )

## Visual Analysis LG3
## QTLs peaks at M33 and loc65
print( cim,lg = 3 )

## Visual Analysis LG4
## QTL peak at M52
print( cim,lg = 4 )
```

Another way is by pointing  the mouse for an
interactive session of function `plot_fullsibQTL`:

```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
plot_fullsibQTL( fullsib = fsib, fullsib.scan = cim, interact = TRUE )
# plot not shown
```

Through the visual analysis we found the following eight QTLs peaks
corresponding to positions next to the cofactors.

```{r}
print( cim, lg = 1, pos = c( "loc13", "M12", "loc45" ) )
```

In a similar way:

```{r, eval=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
print( cim, lg=2, pos = c( "loc45", "loc77", "loc108" ) )
print( cim, lg=3, pos = c( "M33", "loc65" ) )
print( cim, lg=4, pos = "M52" )
```

In order to estimate the total of proportion explained by the QTL
(including the new ones manually selected) and its characterization,
one can use function `cim_char` in the following way:

```{r}
cim_QTL1_lg1 <- cim_char( fullsib = cofs_fs, lg = 1, pheno.col = 1, pos = "loc13" )
cim_QTL2_lg1 <- cim_char( fullsib = cofs_fs, lg = 1, pheno.col = 1, pos = "M12" )
cim_QTL1_lg2 <- cim_char( fullsib = cofs_fs, lg = 2, pheno.col = 1, pos = "loc45" )
cim_QTL2_lg2 <- cim_char( fullsib = cofs_fs, lg = 2, pheno.col = 1, pos = "loc77" )
cim_QTL3_lg2 <- cim_char( fullsib = cofs_fs, lg = 2, pheno.col = 1, pos = "loc108" )
cim_QTL1_lg3 <- cim_char( fullsib = cofs_fs, lg = 3, pheno.col = 1, pos = "M33" )
cim_QTL2_lg3 <- cim_char( fullsib = cofs_fs, lg = 3, pheno.col = 1, pos = "loc65")
cim_QTL1_lg4 <- cim_char( fullsib = cofs_fs, lg = 4, pheno.col = 1 , pos = "M52" )

## Printing the object
cim_QTL1_lg1
```


`cim_QTL1_lg1` is a matrix with 1 column and 15 lines. The flanking
markers of this specific QTL are in the header (M2-M3 in this case).
Then, the first line has the LG information. The second line has the
position in centiMorgan where the region is localized. The third and
fourth lines shows, respectively, $-log_{10}(p_{value})$) and LOD
Score. The fifth line (`mu`) contains the intercept effect of the
model. The lines `alpha.p`, `alpha.q`, and `delta.pq` represent the
QTL genetic effects. The lines `LOD.H1`, `LOD.H2`, and `LOD.H3` are
the statistics for the marginal tests of the respective genetic
effects. These three tests have each 1 degree of freedom (testing if
the effect are different from zero). In this case, a LOD score above
$0.83$ indicates a significant effect (since LOD $= 0.83$ is
equivalent as a LRT $= 3.81$, which under H0 follows a $\chi^2$
distribution with 1 degree of freedom; $3.81$ is for a significance
level of $5%$). The lines `H4.pvalue`, `H5.pvalue`, and `H6.pvalue`
show the p-values for the complementary test in order to detect the
QTL segregation. For more information on interpretations, please see
Gazaffi et al. (2014). Finally, the line `model` shows which model was
evaluated; see details on the vignette *QTL mapping with partially
informative markers* . In some cases, a given test cannot be
evaluated, and so the cells will have `NA` values.

We can also print all the QTLs in a single table:

```{r}
## Printing in a single table
cbind( cim_QTL1_lg1, cim_QTL2_lg1, cim_QTL1_lg2, cim_QTL2_lg2, 
       cim_QTL3_lg2, cim_QTL1_lg3, cim_QTL2_lg3, cim_QTL1_lg4)
```

To evaluate QTL phases, we can use the `get_segr` function:

```{r}
get_segr( cim_QTL1_lg1, probs1 = 0.05, probs2 = 0.05 )
get_segr( cim_QTL2_lg1, probs1 = 0.05, probs2 = 0.05 )
get_segr( cim_QTL1_lg2, probs1 = 0.05, probs2 = 0.05 )
get_segr( cim_QTL2_lg2, probs1 = 0.05, probs2 = 0.05 )
get_segr( cim_QTL3_lg2, probs1 = 0.05, probs2 = 0.05 )
get_segr( cim_QTL1_lg3, probs1 = 0.05, probs2 = 0.05 )
get_segr( cim_QTL2_lg3, probs1 = 0.05, probs2 = 0.05 )
get_segr( cim_QTL1_lg4, probs1 = 0.05, probs2 = 0.05 )
```

And finally, to  draw a rough visualization of  the genetic map with
QTLs and infered phases:

```{r}
draw_phase( cofs_fs, cim_QTL1_lg1 )
draw_phase( cofs_fs, cim_QTL2_lg1 )
draw_phase( cofs_fs, cim_QTL1_lg2 )
draw_phase( cofs_fs, cim_QTL2_lg2 )
draw_phase( cofs_fs, cim_QTL3_lg2 )
draw_phase( cofs_fs, cim_QTL1_lg3 )
draw_phase( cofs_fs, cim_QTL2_lg3 )
draw_phase( cofs_fs, cim_QTL1_lg4 )
```

## Estimating QTL effects using least squares

Function `r2_l2` calculates the proportion of phenotypic variation
explained by the QTL in the model (altogether, denoted by `R2.trait`,
and individually, indicated as `R2.lgX.Y`, where `lgX.Y` means the LG
number $X$ in the $Y$-th position). To do this, a least squares
approximation is used (instead of the mixture model with the EM
algorithm). This is good enough for interpretations, but much faster.
For more information, use `?r2_l2`. 

In this example, for the model with all QTL mapped with CIM and
without the cofactors (since they are only a strategy to control
background variation during the mapping procedure):

```{r}
## Estimating QTL effects without covariate
qtls.cim <- r2_ls( fsib, pheno.col = 1, lg = c( 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4 ),
                   pos = c( "loc13", "M12", "loc45", "loc77", "loc108", "M33", "loc65", "M52" ) )
```

If for some reason one wants also to consider the cofactors:

```{r}
## Estimating QTL effects with covariates
covar <- matrix( rep( c( 1, -1 ), each = 150 ), ncol = 1 )
r2_ls( fsib, pheno.col = 2, addcovar = covar, lg = c( 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4 ),
       pos = c( "loc13", "M12", "loc45", "loc77", "loc108", "M33", "loc65", "M52" ) )
```

## Graphical visualization of QTLs

It is possible to plot a useful visualization of the CIM indicating
the `r2ls.out` object:

```{r}
plot_fullsibQTL( fullsib = fsib,
                 fullsib.scan = cim,
                 r2ls.out = qtls.cim,
                 qtlmapping = "CIM",
                 thr = c( 4.023724, 2.900906 ) )
```
